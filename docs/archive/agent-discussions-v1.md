# Agent Discussions Log - FlyJetr 2.0

## 2025-01-27 14:30 - Project Setup Discussion

**Context**: Setting up prototype for jet charter management interfaces
**Agent**: Claude Sonnet 4
**Duration**: ~15 minutes

### Question Asked:
"Help me prototype the interfaces from section 9 of my design doc - Trip Creation and Client Trip Form"

### Key Recommendations:
1. **Start with React + Vite** - Fast development, modern tooling
2. **Use Firebase + Firestore** - Aligns with Google-only requirement, better than Airtable for custom forms
3. **Focus on interfaces 1 & 2** - Skip vendor entry for now
4. **Follow vibe coding standards** - Maintain organized, documented codebase

### Decision Made:
- Set up React project with proper structure
- Initialize Firebase project and database
- Build Trip Creation form first, then Client form

### Learning/Insights:
- Vite is faster than Create React App for development
- Firestore eliminates Airtable's API rate limits
- Custom forms require proper database, not Airtable's API
- Multi-page forms with guest profile reuse need custom implementation

### Files Updated:
- Project structure created
- Vibe coding rules established
- Firebase integration planned

### Follow-up Questions to Explore:
- How to structure Firestore collections for complex relationships?
- Best approach for multi-page forms with state persistence?
- Webhook integration with CRM system?
